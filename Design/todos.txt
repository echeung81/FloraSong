--pool of yellow things floats down from arbitrary point. appears on your hand when you pick it up. throw it and the bosses HP goes down

boss throws projectile at you at regular intervals--


Branches falling down when sine charge happens X
Percentage chance of things happening X
Up and down a little bit randomly during fight X

lots of fish

THIS WEEK:

Dev Blog X

Create enemy wave prototype
Clean up/Reassess infrastruture
Event driven system?

Level Design in Unity and Asset Loading
Create level prototype 
import music code to game 



i am 36 years old. i need to start thinking about the future. 
career, relationship, etc. don't think about the past except for lesson. think about the present, and who and what will be a part of your future



camera system

event driven system

reassess the whole infrastructure of paths and shooting projectiles. how do we design/script it in the level. what's the effort


scope a running through area

scope a area where a lot of enemies are after you but static or small area



ymin  ymax


currY

currY - ymin

currY - yMax 

pct  chance of moving up and down is 

(currY - yMin) / yWindow

(currY - yMax) / yWindow

if yMin
take a random value 0 and currY - yMin and that's the amount you move up

if yMax
take a random value 0 and currY - yMax and that's the amount you move down

MoveDistance and sign

Create a new spline with 0, 1/3 2/3, 1 with distances set by the yDist.
Create a spline walker with the right duration. (duration is the meters / (meters per second)). this gives seconds. set that param in the anim state by taking 1/secs of movement



amount you move is some random amount between  the distance
